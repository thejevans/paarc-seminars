# Lecture 4: Fitting Models to Data

This lecture was originally designed by the [GRADMAP](https://www.umdgradmap.org/) team at the University of Maryland, College Park. Their copies can be found [on their Github](https://github.com/astroumd/GradMap/tree/master/notebooks) (https://github.com/astroumd/GradMap/tree/master/notebooks). This was GRADMAP Lecture 3 (it has been renamed Lecture 4 in the PAARC seminar series). It was copied in June 2021 and some small edits have been made.
